# stock-chart
Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally.
Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:
<ol> <ul>User Story: I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.</ol>
 <ol> <ul>User Story: I can add new stocks by their symbol name.</ul></ol>
  <ol>User Story: I can remove stocks.</ol>
<ol>User Story: I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.</ol></li>
Once you've finished implementing these user stories, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Heroku.
